## About the Project
Detectify is a real-time object detection system powered by **YOLOv5** and **OpenCV**.  
With just a webcam or video stream, Detectify can recognize multiple objects instantly and display them with **bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores**.  

This project was built as part of the **Real-Time Object Detection Bootcamp** to learn how deep learning models can be integrated into practical AI applications.
